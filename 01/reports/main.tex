\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Assumptions}
The development of application for tracing the movement of people have seen a increasing due to the Covid pandemic. The aim of these apps is to record  paths and meeting of people thus to contain the spread of the virus. The project consist of modeling an app, that uses a NoSQL DB, for that purpose.

\subsection{Delivery specification}
The problem consinst in storing the movements of the user and all people that he met during the day, using Neo4j, a graph NoSQL DB. In addition we have to provide a few queries and commands. We have to discern the family group from the other people, whom are the default contact of the user.

\subsection{Hypothesis }
\begin{description}

\item[Places:]We consider the possibility for a place to have a room, moreover we always know the date and how much time the user spend in that place. The user might visit a place without rooms or visit only one room of a place.
\item[Contacts:]We consider a contact between the user and another person in a specific date, we always know the duration of the meeting.We taking into consideration that two or more people can move from place to place together, in addition every time of the user changes place the app stores the information, so we don't record the information of the place in the contacts. 
\item[Personal data:]
We consider that a person may or may not  have a vaccine/test.

\begin{description}
\item[Person:] contains the personal information, furthermore has the positiveness and the last confirm of it.
We use the last confirm to be able to change the value of the attribute "positive" according with the latest test, moreover if it is true there is at least one covid test in Medical record.
\item[Place:] contains the geographic information, the type and a description.
\item[Room:] contains the name and the capience of the room.
\item[Medical Record:] contains health status,the measure of risk of the user and if he is vaccinated, if it is true there is at least one covid Vaccine. Which collect,by the relations Registered all the tests and the vaccines.
\item[Covid Tests:] contains the date and the results of the covid test.
\item[Covid Vaccines:] contains the date and the type of the covid vaccine.
\item[Has] is the relation between Person and Medical Record,can be absent or at most one.
\item[Has:] is the relation between Place and Room, a place has zero or more rooms, but a room is  only in one place.
\item[Registered:] are the relations by which tests or vaccines are collected in the Medical records.
\item[Contacts:] is the relation that keeps track of the meetings and their duration in a certain date.
\item[Lives:] is the relation trough which we can identify all the components of one family. The user have to live in one place, but not all  places are inhabited.
\item[Visit:] is the relations is the relation that keeps track of all visits in Places/Rooms and their duration in a certain date.

\section{Dataset}
The datasets are made in python, almost the totality of the data are generated with random functions.
